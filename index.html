					“Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” is a classic story of love, genuine friendship, and jealousy. Even Walt Disney chose Snow White for his first animated feature and that changed the entire face of animation as well as history in film making. The main character of the fairy tale is a beautiful girl Snow White who lost her mother as a child.
