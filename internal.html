	Pythagoras theorem states that <strong>“In a right-angled triangle,  the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides“</strong>. The sides of this triangle have been named as Perpendicular, Base and Hypotenuse. Here, the <ins>hypotenuse is the longest side, as it is opposite to the angle</ins> 
90<strong><sup>°</sup></strong>. The sides of a right triangle <del>(say a, b and c) </del>which have <strong>+<sub>ve</sub> </strong>integer values, when squared, are put into an equation, also called a <ins><mark>Pythagorean triple</mark></ins>
