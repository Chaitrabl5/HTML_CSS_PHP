    <td>An unrivaled teacher with immense knowledge, Aryabhata is a name to be reckoned with from ancient India. His expansive knowledge covered areas of Maths, Astronomy, and Science. He wrote a comprehensive treatise titled the “Aryabhatiya” which in its range covered various integral topics of mathematics like trigonometry and algebra. He was the first to give an approximation of the value of pi and drew various other deductions related to formulas in mathematics. As the founder of the Number system, his contribution to mathematics was unprecedented and thus is placed first in our list of famous Indian mathematicians.</td>
    <td>Ramanujan is one of the greatest mathematical geniuses of India who worked with elliptic functions and analytical theory of numbers. He conducted profound research to calculate the value of Euler’s constant. What is interesting to note is that Ramanujan was the first Indian to be elected as a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge University. There he continued his work in collaboration with other fellows and made several other contributions to the field of Mathematics. The mysteries solved by the man who knew infinity are still used to work for the development of the field of Mathematics.</td>
